## Object and Properties
- The environment where your game resides is called the game world
- everything in the game world is called a GameObject (GO)
- you can organize GO in the Hierarchy
- when you click on a GO, the Inspector pops up
- the Inspector contains all the properties of the object that gives it funtionality 
- you can create GO or drag GO from the Project window into the scene
- you must bake an object to make it walkable??

## Windows
- Scene window - game world editor
- Game window - test play
- Asset Store window - asset store
- Hierarchy window - where GOs are organized
- Inspector window - properties of GOs
- Project window - where assets are located (works like file explorer)
